            This experience was awesome! <br /> <br />
            I've done my erasmus+ in Dublin, first of all because itÂ´s a great
            city for the IT area and I knew it would be great for my resume and
            to experience the work ethic and culture in a working environment.{' '}
            <br />
            <br />
            But never thought it would be this great.
            <br />
            <br />
            My daily live there was:
            <br />
            During the week, work since 10AM to 4:30PM the lunch time was open
            for me to manage that but usually was at 12:30PM to 01:30PM/02:30
            always depending on the work that I've done in the morning and what
            I had left to do. I always had lunch with my colleges we had a group
            that always went to get lunch together. <br />
            After work usually I would get some pints with my colleges, the
            erasmus group, with some house mates or with the international
            group. <br />
            They have an awesome social culture so most of cases and for the
            rest of the people was about the same, it's almost a tradition to go
            for some pints after work.
            <br />
            Most of the days that pints just ended after 10PM/12PM and in some
            cases even later or sooner hahah. <br />
            <br />
            On the weekend was about the same but heavier, not always tho. was
            during the weekend that I had more time to get to know the city
            better, and do other trips for other towns in Ireland. <br />
            <br />
            I've rented a car there so i had my first experience driving in the
            other side, everything in on the opposite side so was tricky at
            first, but after some minutes it was already in autopilot mode.{' '}
            <br />
            <br />
            It was awesome, I had such a great moments, met such an awesome
            people world wide, it was realy, realy cool.
            <br />
            I totally recommend Dublin to every one! You will have the time of
            your life.
            <br />
            I've done a timeline / chronology of my erasmus experience so if you
            are curious about it and wanna have a lock, check my instagram.
            <br /> I have there almost every day during the all the erasmus
            time, you can check my stories, pictures and videos from everyday
            there.
